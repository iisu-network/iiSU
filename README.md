# üöÄ Quick Start Guide for iiSU DS

## 1. Before You Begin
iiSU DS is currently in an **early Alpha stage**, focused on building the technical foundation of the launcher for future iterations.  
For now, it is recommended to set it as your **home screen only in controlled test scenarios**.

---

## 2. Preparing Your Asset Library

### 2.1. Paths and Folder Structure
- **ROMs:** Place custom icons inside `iiSULauncher/assets/roms` in any external media directory created by Android for the app (e.g.,  
  `/storage/emulated/0/Android/media/com.iisulauncher/iiSULauncher/assets/roms`).  
  The application will create these folders if they don‚Äôt exist.  

- **APPs:** Place custom icons inside `iiSULauncher/assets/android` in any external media directory created by Android for the app (e.g.,  
  `/storage/emulated/0/Android/media/com.iisulauncher/iiSULauncher/assets/android`).  
  The application will create these folders if they don‚Äôt exist.  

- **Platforms:** Icons and backgrounds for each system are stored in `iiSULauncher/assets/platforms`, accessible from both `externalMediaDirs` and the legacy path:  
  `/storage/emulated/0/Android/media/com.iisulauncher/iiSULauncher/assets/platforms`.

### 2.2. Recommended Naming Convention
- Use **PNG or JPG** files. For each ROM or App, name the icon as `<sanitized_name>_X.png` (or `.jpg`), where **X** is:
  - `_icon` ‚Üí Icon displayed on the main screen  
  - `_slide_Y` ‚Üí Images for the gallery, where **Y** is the index (1, 2, 3 ‚Ä¶)  
  - `_hero_Y` ‚Üí Background images for the top screen, where **Y** is the index (1, 2, 3 ‚Ä¶)  

- Names are **automatically sanitized**:
  - Accents and special characters removed  
  - Spaces replaced with underscores  
  - Converted to lowercase  
  - Example: `The Legend: GB` ‚Üí `the_legend_gb`  

- For platforms you can provide:
  - **Icon:** `<platform>.png`  
  - **List background:** `<platform>_list.png`  
  - **Selected list background:** `<platform>_list_selected.png`  

üí° *Note: The repo includes a `iiSULauncher` folder containing the minimum required assets for configuration.*

## 3. First Launch and Shortcuts
In the **Home** section you‚Äôll find the quick-access grid.  
Tap the **‚ÄúEdit‚Äù** button to enable edit mode.  

To pin an app or ROM:
- Open its settings card  
- Hold the icon to enter edit mode, then hold it again to open per APP/ROM Settings  
  - Or with a controller: press **‚ÄúY‚Äù** to enter edit mode, then **‚ÄúStart‚Äù**  
- Enable the **Shortcut** checkbox in the preferences panel  

This preference is saved **persistently** in the launcher‚Äôs configuration.

---

## 4. Choosing Where to Launch Each App or ROM
When launching an app or ROM for the first time, a dialog will appear asking you to choose a screen (**internal or external**) and whether to **remember your selection**.  

If you check the box, the launcher will automatically save this preference for future launches.  

You can also adjust this behavior at any time from the item‚Äôs settings dialog:
- **Internal**  
- **External**  
- **Always Ask**  

Here you can also manage shortcuts and app linking.

---

## 5. Organizing the Apps, Games, and Emulators Tabs
The three main tabs (**APPS, GAMES, EMULATORS**).  

To customize:
- Enter edit mode (long-press an app in the corresponding tab)  
- Use the **visibility toggle** to hide items you don‚Äôt want  

Visibility is saved **per tab**, so each view keeps its own selection.

### 6. Supported Emulators

### 7. RetroAchievements Integration

iiSU Launcher now supports [RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org)!

To enable it, you'll need your **RetroAchievements username** and **Web API Key**.

#### üîë How to get your Web API Key:
1. Log into [RetroAchievements.org](https://retroachievements.org).
2. Go to your profile settings.
3. Scroll down to the **Web API Key** section and copy it.

Once you've configured your credentials in iiSU DS, the following will happen:
- In the RetroAchievements tab, you‚Äôll see a summary of your recent activity, showing the most recent games where you‚Äôve unlocked achievements, along with your total points and progress.
- When entering a platform, the launcher will **start hashing your ROMs in the background** to identify them with RetroAchievements.
- While hashing, a loading icon will appear in the top-left corner of each ROM.
- Once a ROM is identified, hovering over it will **trigger a background request** to fetch the list of achievements for that specific game.
  - During this process, you‚Äôll see a loading icon again on that ROM.
  - Once complete, if the ROM doesn‚Äôt have a custom icon, it will show the `ImageBoxArt.png` provided by RetroAchievements.

You can view the available achievements at any time by pressing **X** or **Y** on your controller (depending on your button layout).

‚ö†Ô∏è For best performance, avoid requesting achievements for too many games at once. Achievement fetching is currently manual and per-ROM, but **batch fetching and automation will be added soon.**

## 8. Project Status
Remember: **iiSU DS is a prototype** aimed at testing on dual-screen and single screen hardware.  
Please use it as a **testbed**, report bugs, and share feedback or features you‚Äôd like to see before considering it ready for daily use.
